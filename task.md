## Overview

Design and implement a small mobile UI based on the Pinterest board above. You can either follow the reference exactly or use it as a guide, what matters most is a clean, modern design, thoughtful micro-interactions, and a sensible approach to data fetching.

## Requirements

1. Design Quality

   - Clean, consistent typography and spacing.
   - Clear visual hierarchy and accessible contrast.
   - Responsive/adaptive behavior for common phone sizes.
   - Light or dark theme: your choice (you do not have to do both).

2. Micro-Interactions

- Subtle animations/transitions that enhance usability (e.g., button press states, list item touch feedback, skeleton loaders, pull-to-refresh, toast/inline status for actions).
- Avoid distracting or long animations.

1. Data & State

- Use any free public API to populate the UI (no paid keys). Examples:
- JSONPlaceholder (posts/photos), PokeAPI, Rick & Morty API, Studio Ghibli API, SpaceX, Open Library.
- Show loading, empty, and error states where necessary.
- Demonstrate a clear data fetching methodology (e.g., fetch + caching strategy, pagination or infinite scroll if applicable).

4. Engineering

   - Set up a modern project structure (clear folders, linting, formatting).
   - Include types (TypeScript preferred).
   - Use a state/data library if it helps (e.g., React Query/TanStack Query, SWR) or explain your choice if going vanilla.
   - Include basic testing for at least one component or hook (even a small test is fine).

## Deliverables

- UI Screens (Figma link or exported PNGs) showing key states:

  - Main list/grid view, detail view, loading/skeleton, empty, and error.
  - If using a different design dont make it more than 3 pages

- Source Code (GitHub/GitLab link) with:
- README.md including:
- Tech stack & architectural notes.
- Data fetching approach (and why).
- How to run the project locally.
- Any trade-offs or known limitations.
- Build Instructions:
- Commands to install and run on a simulator/emulator.
- Note if you used Expo or bare React Native.
- (Optional but nice) Short screen recording (≤2 minutes) walking through the app and micro-interactions.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Design polish & UX clarity (layout, spacing, contrast, typography).
- Micro-interaction quality (useful, smooth, unobtrusive).
- Code quality (structure, readability, typing, linting).
- Data handling (loading/empty/error states, caching/pagination).
- Documentation (clear README and setup).
- Scope vs. time (smart choices, not over-engineering).

## Tech Notes

- Framework: React Native (Expo or bare: your choice).
- Styling: Any approach (e.g., StyleSheet, styled-components, Tailwind RN). Keep it consistent.
- Animations: Reanimated).
- Avoid complex auth flows; pick APIs that don’t require OAuth.

## Submission

Please send:

- Repo link + README
- (Optional) short demo video
